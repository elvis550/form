# User Registration Form

A semantic HTML5 implementation of a user registration form based on provided design specifications.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the ability to create accessible and well-structured web forms using semantic HTML5 elements, proper labeling, and input types without relying on CSS for layout or styling.

## Form Sections

The form is divided into the following logical sections:
1.  **Personal Information:** Captures basic user details (Name, DOB, Gender, etc.).
2.  **Contact & Address Information:** Collects user contact details and location.
3.  **Preferences & Interests:** Gathers user experience,interests,educational level,etc


## Implementation Notes

- **Semantic HTML:** Used `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<section>`, and appropriate input types to ensure meaning and accessibility.
- **Accessibility:** All form controls are properly associated with their `<label>` elements using the `for` and `id` attributes. Used `fieldset` and `legend` to group related items.
- **Input Types:** Leveraged modern HTML5 input types like `email`, `url`, `date`, `number`, and `password` for better validation and user experience on supported devices.
  
## How to Use/View

1.  Clone this repository or download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3.  The form is fully functional for viewing and interaction. (Note: It does not submit data to a server as there is no backend implementation).
